    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Momo, (Chicken Momo, Buff Momo, Vegetable Momo) is the Nepali version of dumpling. It is a traditional delicacy
        in
        Nepal, Tibet, China, Bhutan and certain parts of India. Its filling can be vegetables, chicken, lamb, mutton and
        more.
        In India it’s also known as Momos.</p>
    <p>Dal, Bhaat and Tarkari (Lentils soup, Rice and Vegetables or Meat) is the most important meal for any Nepali but
        lately
        Momo have become a staple of Nepali food culture. One can find Momo at every corner of the city: on road side
        stalls,
        local dining restaurants or high end restaurants. Momo can be eaten as snacks or dinner and can be served on any
        occasion.

        One interesting thing about Momo is that everyone can get involved while preparing (wrapping). Momo can be
        wrapped in
        different shapes and people experiment with the wrapping style all the time. Some people wrap Momo in a
        triangular shape
        while others wrap it in a rectangular shape but the most popular one is round shaped Momo. There is also a new
        fashion
        of Open Momo in the market now. Momo is cooked usually by steaming but can also be pan fried (Kothey Momo). Momo
        is
        served with special tomato or sesame based sauce (aachar) that can be mild or hot.

        Momo, traditional delicacy in China and Tibet, were brought to Nepal by Tibetan immigrants. Nepali people have
        added
        their own spices and twists to this amazing dish and made it as popular as Dal, Bhaat and Tarkari.</p>
