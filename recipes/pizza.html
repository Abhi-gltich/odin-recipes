    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive
        oil,
        oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a
        commercial
        setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
    <p>One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce,
        mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was
        said to
        have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were
        those of
        the Italian flag.</p>
    <p>Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with
        buffalo
        mozzarella (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte (mozzarella produced from
        the milk
        of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano (a variety of grape tomato grown
        in
        Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) and uses onions and olives. The
        Ligurian pizza
        resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, adding anchovies to olives and onions. Pizza has also spread
        from
        Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with
        the
        ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.</p>
    <p>The popularity of pizza in the United States began with the Italian community in New York City, where the
        Neapolitan
        pizza had an early influence. The first pizzeria appeared in New York City about the turn of the 20th century.
        After
        World War II the pizza industry boomed. Soon there was scarcely a hamlet without a pizzeria. Sausage, bacon,
        ground
        beef, pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers are traditional toppings familiar to many Americans, but ingredients as
        varied
        as arugula, pancetta, and truffles have found their way onto pizzas there. Variations are also often tied to
        different
        regions in the country, Chicago’s deep-dish pizza and California-style pizza among them.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Homemade Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon Basil Pesto or Basil Cashew Pesto</li>
        <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the pizza dough:All-purpose flour also works for this homemade pizza dough recipe. The main advantage
            of using all-purpose flour for
            pizza dough is that it is widely available and inexpensive. However, the gluten content in all-purpose flour
            is not as
            high as Tipo 00 or bread flour flour, so the pizza crust is slightly more dense and crumbly. However,
            all-purpose flour
            still makes for an excellent homemade pizza dough!</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven</li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce:
            <h3>Ingredients for sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Canned fire roasted tomatoes</li>
                <li>Small garlic clove</li>
                <li>Dried oregano</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Making the sauce:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mince or peel the garlic</li>
                <li>Mix everything (or blend)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photo). If
            it’s
            incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove
            moisture for
            about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t
            have a pizza
            peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well
            worth the
            investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella
            cheese. Top
            with a few pinches of salt.
        </li>
        <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the
            cheese and
            crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
        <li>Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
